            <p class="text-olbra-muted leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Cookies are small text files that are placed on your device (computer, tablet, or mobile phone) when you visit a website. They are widely used to make websites work more efficiently, provide a better user experience, and give website owners information about how their site is being used.

            <p class="text-olbra-muted leading-relaxed">
              Cookies can be "persistent" (remaining on your device until deleted or until they expire) or "session" cookies (deleted when you close your browser). They can also be "first-party" (set by the website you are visiting) or "third-party" (set by a domain other than the one you are visiting).
