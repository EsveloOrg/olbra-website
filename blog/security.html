              In the world of digital assets, security breaches can be catastrophic and irreversible. That's why security at Olbra isn't an afterthought—it's woven into every aspect of our operations, from how we store assets to how we write code to how we respond to incidents. This article provides an overview of our security approach.
            </p>

            <h2 class="heading-md text-olbra-dark mt-12 mb-4">Multi-Signature Custody</h2>
            <p class="text-olbra-muted leading-relaxed mb-6">
              The most fundamental security measure is how we custody assets. We use multi-signature (multisig) wallets that require multiple independent approvals before any transaction can be executed.
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-olbra-muted space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
              <li><strong class="text-olbra-dark">Threshold Signatures:</strong> Our operational wallets require a minimum of 3-of-5 signatures from authorized key holders. This means a single compromised key cannot move funds.</li>
              <li><strong class="text-olbra-dark">Geographic Distribution:</strong> Key holders are distributed across multiple locations and time zones. This prevents single points of failure and makes coordinated attacks extremely difficult.</li>
              <li><strong class="text-olbra-dark">Hardware Security Modules:</strong> Private keys are stored in HSMs—specialized hardware devices designed to resist physical and digital tampering. Keys never exist in plain text outside these devices.</li>
              <li><strong class="text-olbra-dark">Institutional Custody Partners:</strong> For additional security, a portion of reserves is held with licensed institutional custodians who provide insurance coverage and additional operational controls.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="heading-md text-olbra-dark mt-12 mb-4">Smart Contract Security</h2>
            <p class="text-olbra-muted leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Smart contracts are the backbone of DeFi—and a common attack vector. We take a defense-in-depth approach to contract security:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-olbra-muted space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
              <li><strong class="text-olbra-dark">Independent Audits:</strong> All production contracts undergo multiple audits from reputable security firms before deployment. We don't rely on a single auditor's opinion.</li>
              <li><strong class="text-olbra-dark">Formal Verification:</strong> Critical contract logic undergoes formal verification—mathematical proofs that the code behaves as intended under all possible conditions.</li>
              <li><strong class="text-olbra-dark">Bug Bounty Program:</strong> We maintain an active bug bounty program that rewards security researchers for responsibly disclosing vulnerabilities. Bounties scale with severity, with critical findings earning substantial rewards.</li>
              <li><strong class="text-olbra-dark">Staged Deployments:</strong> New contracts are deployed to testnets first, then to mainnet with limited exposure, before being fully enabled. This catches issues before they can cause significant harm.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="heading-md text-olbra-dark mt-12 mb-4">Operational Security</h2>
            <p class="text-olbra-muted leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Technical measures are only part of the picture. We also implement rigorous operational security practices:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-olbra-muted space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
              <li><strong class="text-olbra-dark">Access Controls:</strong> Employees have access only to the systems and data necessary for their roles. Access is reviewed regularly and revoked immediately when no longer needed.</li>
              <li><strong class="text-olbra-dark">Two-Factor Authentication:</strong> All internal systems require hardware-based 2FA. We don't accept SMS or app-based codes for sensitive operations.</li>
              <li><strong class="text-olbra-dark">Security Training:</strong> All team members undergo regular security awareness training, including phishing simulations and incident response drills.</li>
              <li><strong class="text-olbra-dark">Vendor Assessment:</strong> Third-party services we rely on are assessed for their security practices before integration and monitored continuously thereafter.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="heading-md text-olbra-dark mt-12 mb-4">Insurance Coverage</h2>
            <p class="text-olbra-muted leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Despite all preventive measures, we maintain insurance as a last line of defense:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-olbra-muted space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
              <li><strong class="text-olbra-dark">Custody Insurance:</strong> Assets held with institutional custodians are covered by their insurance policies, protecting against theft, fraud, and certain operational failures.</li>
              <li><strong class="text-olbra-dark">Crime Insurance:</strong> We maintain policies covering employee theft, cyber fraud, and social engineering attacks.</li>
              <li><strong class="text-olbra-dark">Protocol Coverage:</strong> We're exploring on-chain insurance protocols that can provide additional coverage for smart contract risks.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-olbra-muted leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Insurance doesn't prevent breaches, but it provides a recovery mechanism if prevention fails. We view it as essential infrastructure, not optional protection.
            </p>

            <h2 class="heading-md text-olbra-dark mt-12 mb-4">Incident Response</h2>
            <p class="text-olbra-muted leading-relaxed mb-6">
              How you respond to incidents matters as much as prevention. Our incident response framework includes:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-olbra-muted space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
              <li><strong class="text-olbra-dark">24/7 Monitoring:</strong> Automated systems monitor for anomalies in contract behavior, unusual transaction patterns, and infrastructure issues. Alerts trigger immediate investigation.</li>
              <li><strong class="text-olbra-dark">Emergency Procedures:</strong> We have documented, tested procedures for various incident types—from contract vulnerabilities to infrastructure compromises to social engineering attempts.</li>
              <li><strong class="text-olbra-dark">Circuit Breakers:</strong> Critical contracts include pause functionality that can halt operations if an exploit is detected, limiting potential damage while the issue is resolved.</li>
              <li><strong class="text-olbra-dark">Communication Plans:</strong> We have pre-established channels and templates for communicating with users during incidents—transparency is critical for maintaining trust.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="heading-md text-olbra-dark mt-12 mb-4">What You Can Do</h2>
            <p class="text-olbra-muted leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Security is a shared responsibility. Here's how you can protect yourself when using Olbra:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-olbra-muted space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
              <li><strong class="text-olbra-dark">Use Hardware Wallets:</strong> Store significant holdings in hardware wallets rather than hot wallets or exchange accounts.</li>
              <li><strong class="text-olbra-dark">Verify Contracts:</strong> Always verify you're interacting with official Olbra contracts. Check addresses against our documentation before approving transactions.</li>
              <li><strong class="text-olbra-dark">Beware of Phishing:</strong> We will never ask for your private keys or seed phrase. Official communications only come from verified channels.</li>
              <li><strong class="text-olbra-dark">Start Small:</strong> When trying new protocols or features, start with small amounts until you're comfortable with how they work.</li>
              <li><strong class="text-olbra-dark">Keep Software Updated:</strong> Ensure your wallet software and browser are up to date with the latest security patches.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="heading-md text-olbra-dark mt-12 mb-4">Continuous Improvement</h2>
            <p class="text-olbra-muted leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Security is never "done." The threat landscape evolves constantly, and so must our defenses. We continuously:
            </p>
